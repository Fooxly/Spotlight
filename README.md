## ü§î&nbsp; Asking questions

Whilst having a powerful spotlight at the tips of your hands. We also provide an easy way to ask questions. With the following command you can open the Spotlight UI with a specific question to be answered.

Spotlight.question('What is your name?');
Spotlight.question('What is your favorite animal?', ['Dog', 'Cat', 'Fish']);
```

When adding custom answers to the question you can use the same syntax as in the `RegisterCommand` method. So there is support for single strings or an object with an `title`, `keywords` and `icon`.

## ‚úÖ&nbsp; In need of confirmations?

```js
import Spotlight from '@fooxly/spotlight';

Spotlight.toast('Hello world!');
```


## ü™Ñ&nbsp; Customization

While customizing the spotlight itself is only limited to the `isDarkMode`, `showRecentlyUsed` and `showTips` property, our results can also be customized. Every result can have it's own icon. We have a library of icons which you can choose from or link to custom images. And to make it even better, we support emojis ü§© as icons too.
